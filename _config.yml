  I am Phillip Green, a software engineer and freelance developer with a passion for game development, web design, and building digital solutions for small businesses. Currently pursuing a BS in Applied Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi, Iâ€™ve recently launched Green Digital Solutions to help businesses with their online presence.

  In my free time, I love playing video games, spending time with my family, and working on indie game development projects.

      I enjoy diving into complex coding problems and coming up with creative solutions. My interests include game development, software engineering, and web design. I am always keen to learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects.

      Outside of tech, I love spending time with my wife and kids, exploring new video games, and reading my favorite book series, the Grishaverse.
