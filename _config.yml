  I am Phillip Green, a software engineer and freelance developer specializing in game development, web design, and digital solutions for small businesses. Iâ€™m pursuing a BS in Applied Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi while actively running my business, Green Digital Solutions.

  Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games, and working on indie game development projects.
