about_content: |
  I'm a software engineer, indie game dev, and freelance web designer with a passion for clean code and bold ideas. After years in quality engineering, I transitioned into tech and never looked back.

  I now specialize in building responsive websites, launching digital brands, and writing clean, purposeful code. I'm currently studying Applied Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi while running my freelance business, Green Digital Solutions.

  Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring open-world games, diving into fantasy books, or enjoying life with my amazing wife and kids.
